Weight Tracking App README

The Weight Tracking App is a mobile application designed to help users monitor and manage their weight effectively. This app was developed as part of a course project aimed at applying mobile app development best practices and user-centered design principles. The primary goal was to create an intuitive and functional app that addresses the needs of users who are focused on maintaining a healthy lifestyle by tracking their weight over time. The app allows users to log their daily weight, set personal goals, track progress through graphical representations, and receive notifications for daily entries and goal achievement.

The primary requirements for the Weight Tracking App included creating a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily log their weight, view their progress, and set weight goals. The app was designed to address the user needs of consistency in weight tracking, motivation through goal setting, and ease of use through an intuitive UI. By focusing on these aspects, the app aims to assist users in achieving and maintaining their fitness objectives.

To support user needs, the app includes several key screens and features:

    Login Screen: Allows users to securely log in or create a new account.
    Home Screen: Displays a grid view of daily weight entries, with options to add, edit, or delete entries.
    Goal Setting Screen: Enables users to set a target weight goal and receive notifications when the goal is achieved.
    Progress Chart: Provides a graphical representation of the userâ€™s weight over time, helping them visualize their progress.

The UI was designed with the user in mind, ensuring ease of navigation and clarity in displaying information. The simple layout, intuitive controls, and clear feedback mechanisms contributed to the success of the designs.

The coding process for the Weight Tracking App was systematic, starting with setting up the basic app structure, followed by implementing the core functionalities, and then refining the UI. I utilized an iterative approach, where I would regularly test each feature as it was developed to ensure functionality and usability. Techniques such as modular coding and the use of SQLite for database management were key strategies that facilitated smooth development. These techniques can be applied in future projects to ensure scalability and maintainability.

Testing was a crucial part of the development process. I employed both manual testing and debugging tools within Android Studio to ensure that the code was functional and free of errors. This process was important as it helped identify and resolve issues early, leading to a more stable final product. It also revealed areas where the user experience could be improved, which was then addressed in subsequent iterations.

Throughout the design and development process, there were several challenges that required innovative solutions. One such challenge was ensuring compatibility with multiple Android versions while maintaining performance and functionality. By leveraging the latest Android features and adhering to best practices, I was able to overcome these challenges and deliver a robust application.

One area where I particularly demonstrated my knowledge, skills, and experience was in implementing the weight entry and tracking features. The seamless integration of the SQLite database for storing and retrieving weight data, combined with the user-friendly UI for data input and visualization, showcases my ability to create a functional and user-centered mobile application.
